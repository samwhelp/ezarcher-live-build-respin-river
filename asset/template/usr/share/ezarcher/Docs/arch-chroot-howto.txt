Basic Arch Chroot Instructions

Step 1: Boot into the live environment from any current Ezarcher ISO.

    Boot your computer from an Arch Linux live USB or CD

Step 2: Mount your partitions.

   Identify your partitions:

      sudo lsblk -f

   NOTE: Take note of the partitions that contain the root filesystem and the EFI filesystem (if needed). 
   Other partitions are not typically needed for normal system maintenance.

   Mount the root partition of your installed system to /mnt (adjust /dev/sda2 if needed):

      sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt

   If you have a separate boot (or EFI) partition, mount that as well (adjust /mnt/efi if needed):

      sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/efi

   NOTE: If you are using a BTRFS filesystem, you may need to mount subvolumes before chrooting.

Step 3: Chroot into the system.

   Run the arch-chroot command:

        sudo arch-chroot /mnt

   NOTE: This command will change your root directory to the one you specified and set up the necessary virtual filesystems.

Step 4: Perform maintenance.

    Once inside the chroot, you can run commands as if you were on your installed system.
    You can install or update packages, regenerate your bootloader, fix boot issues, or reset passwords.

Step 5: Exit the chroot.

    When you are finished, exit the chroot environment by typing exit or pressing Ctrl+d.
